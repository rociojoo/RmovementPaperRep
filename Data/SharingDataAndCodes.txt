Plan for stocking data and codes:

Codes will be in GitHub repository:

rociojoo/RmovementPaperRep

everything in that repository will disappear except for some of the content in Data (which will be in the root)

- data from survey: survey_responses_20190130.csv (Dryad; necessary for replicating results for documentation)
- standardized names for packages: packages_survey_names.csv (GitHub; necessary for replicating results for documentation)
- data with packages information: RmovementPackagesInformation-20190227.csv (Dryad; also necessary for replicating results for documentation)
- list of packages reviewed in the paper: packages_paper.csv (GitHub; necessary for replicating results for documentation)
- code for fig. 3 in the manuscript: ResultsDoc.R (needing all the files mentioned above)

- code for fig. 4 in the manuscript: PackageNetwork.R
- uses packages_paper.csv
- data about imports and suggests: RmovePackages-ImportSuggest-20180830.csv (Dryad)
- uses RmovementPackagesInformation-20190227.csv
- data about imports only: RmovePackages-Import-20180830.csv (Dryad)
