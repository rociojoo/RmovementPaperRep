There are many existing techniques for handling location error, but these are often ad hoc or are used in isolation from each other. In this study we present a Bayesian framework for determining location that uses all the data available, is flexible to all tagging techniques, and provides location estimates with built-in measures of uncertainty. Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models. The approach provides a substantial contribution to the handling uncertainty in archival tag and satellite tracking data using readily available tools.},

A state-space Kalman filter statistical model was used to estimate geolocation errors, movement parameters, and most probable tracks from the recovered data. Standard deviation estimates ranged from 0.5° to 4.4° latitude and from 0.2° to 1.6° longitude. Bias estimates ranged from −1.9° to 4.1° latitude and from −0.5° to 3.0° longitude. Estimates of directed movement were close to zero for most fish reaching a maximum magnitude of 5.3 nm day−1 for the one fish that moved away from its release site. Diffusivity estimates were also low, ranging from near zero to 1000 nm2 day−1. Low values of the estimated movement parameters are consistent with the restricted scale of the observed movement and the apparent fidelity of bigeye to geographical points of attraction. Inclusion of a time-dependent model of the variance in geolocation estimates reduced the variability of latitude estimates. The state-space Kalman filter model appears to provide realistic estimates of in situ geolocation errors and movement parameters, provides a means to avoid indeterminate latitude estimates during equinoxes, and is a potential bridge between analyses of individual and population movements.},

	abstract = {Tracking marine animals with electronic tags has become an indispensable tool in understanding biology in relation to movement. Combining light based geolocation estimates with an underlying movement model has proved helpful in reconstructing the most probable track of tagged animals. These tracks can be further improved by including the tag measured sea-surface temperature and matching it to external sea-surface temperature ({SST}) data. The current methodology for doing this in a state-space model requires that external sea-surface temperature be smoothed before it is used in the model, and further that its gradient field is pre-calculated. This two-step approach has a number of technical drawbacks, and the final statistical inference about the most probable track is consequently less convincing. This paper presents a new methodology (refer to as {UKFSST}) where all steps, including the {SST} smoothing, are handled within one coherent model. An additional benefit is that even the degree of smoothing, which was previously pre-determined and fixed, can now be optimally selected. {UKFSST} offers better handling of non-linearities in Kalman filter, and provides a statistically sound model for geolocation applications, as opposed to ad hoc {SST} matching approaches.},

	abstract = {Archival and pop-up satellite archival tags have been widely used to study the movement dynamics in many marine pelagic species. Recent advances in light-based geolocation models have enabled better estimation of the geographical positions of tagged animals. In particular, {TrackIt}, a state-space model with the Kalman filter, uses only light data from a tag for estimating positions and does so independently of manufacturer calculations. This approach is a complete break from previous geolocation methodologies, which rely on manufacturer-processed positions as an input. In this paper, a unified model is presented to extend {TrackIt} to incorporate satellite sea-surface temperature ({SST}) matching, an approach that has been demonstrated to improve accuracy. The performance of various satellite {SST} imagery products is also evaluated by the comparison of {SST}-inclusive models against the basic {TrackIt} model using only light information. Three new model parameters (bias, error and smoothing radius) are introduced for handling {SST} observations. Analyses based on double-tagging comparisons show that the overall accuracy of {TrackIt} increases with the incorporation of {SST}, even when the resolution of the matching satellite product is rather coarse. At the same time, the model accuracy can decrease when the {SST} observations do not exhibit any strong trends, rendering {SST} matching less informative. The incorporation of {SST} within this generic and statistically sound modeling framework illustrates how {TrackIt} can readily be extended to utilize new data streams, such as geomagnetic data, which will become available with the next generation of archival tags.},

	abstract = {Abstract Solar geolocation is used to quantify the movements of animals tagged with sensors that record ambient light with respect to time. Global location sensor ({GLS}) tags are small, light, and present minimal drag or wing loading. They are affordable, and some can record data for several migratory cycles. These benefits mean they can be used in applications for which satellite tags are unsuitable. However, large errors in estimated locations can result if the sensor is obscured, especially around twilight, and sometimes the data obtained is unusable by existing methods of analysis due to this source of noise. This places limitations on the usefulness of solar geolocation in conservation and monitoring efforts. All existing methods of analysis are dependent on twilights being identifiable or faithfully recorded. Instead, the method introduced here depends on the overall pattern of day and night to calculate the likelihoods for a Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are geographic locations. We call this a ?twilight?free? method of light?based geolocation. This method quickly estimates locations from otherwise unusable noisy light data. We use examples to show that the method produces tracks that are comparable in accuracy and precision to other geolocation methods. Furthermore, efficiency and replicability of estimated paths are improved because the user does not have to subjectively identify twilights. Other data sources, such as sea surface temperature and land or sea masks are easily incorporated, further improving location estimates and processing speed. The twilight?free method offers new opportunities to researchers interested in the movements of animals that routinely have obscured sensors, or to analyse previously unusable noisy light data. It offers a fast, efficient, and replicable method for analysing tag data without the need for time?consuming pre? or post?processing. By increasing the yield of usable data from {GLS} tagging studies, researchers can more efficiently quantify where animals are going and when, and monitor changes in habitat. This is of fundamental importance to management and conservation efforts.},

Open-source oceanographic measurements and outputs from high-resolution models are increasingly available and accessible. Temperature and depth profiles recorded by electronic tags can be integrated with these empirical data and model outputs to construct likelihoods and improve geolocation estimates. The R package {HMMoce} leverages available tag and oceanographic data to improve position estimates derived from electronic tags using a hidden Markov approach. We illustrate the use of the model and test its performance using example blue and mako shark archival tag data. Model results were validated using independent, known tracks and compared to results from other geolocation approaches. {HMMoce} exhibited as much as six-fold improvement in pointwise error as compared to traditional light-level geolocation approaches.

However, the aquatic behavior of most of these species results in a high number of locations with low or unknown accuracy. Argos data are often filtered to reduce the noise produced by these locations, typically by removing data points requiring unrealistic swimming speeds. Unfortunately, this method excludes a considerable number of good?quality locations that have high traveling speeds that are the result of two locations being taken very close in time. We present an alternative algorithm, based on swimming speed, distance between successive locations, and turning angles. This new filter was tested on 67 tracks from nine different marine mammal species: ringed, bearded, gray, harbor, southern elephant, and Antarctic fur seals, walruses, belugas, and narwhals. The algorithm removed similar percentages of low?quality locations (Argos location classes [{LC}] B and A) compared to a filter based solely on swimming speed, but preserved significantly higher percentages of good?quality positions (mean ± {SE}\% of locations removed was 4.1 ± 0.8\%vs. 12.6 ± 1.2\% for {LC} 3; 6.8 ± 0.6\%vs. 15.7 ± 0.9\% for {LC} 2; and 11.4 ± 0.7\%vs. 21.0 ± 0.9\% for {LC} 1). The new filter was also more effective at removing unlikely, conspicuous deviations from the track's path, resulting in fewer locations being registered on land and a significant reduction in home range size, when using the Minimum Convex Polygon method, which is sensitive to outliers.},

Achieving the intended conservation benefits will depend, in part, on whether or not the released animals remain at the new human-selected location. The present study tested the hypothesis that hard-shelled sea turtles along the coast of north-eastern Australia (9–28°S, 142–153°E) would not remain at new locations and would attempt to return to their original areas. We used satellite-tracking data gathered previously for different purposes over several years (1996–2014). Some turtles had been released at their capture sites, inferred to be home areas, while other turtles had been displaced (released away from their inferred home areas) for various reasons. All non-displaced turtles (n = 54) remained at their home areas for the duration of tracking. Among displaced turtles (n = 59), the large majority travelled back to their respective home areas (n = 52) or near home (n = 4). Homing turtles travelled faster and adopted straighter routes in cooler water and travelled faster by day than by night. Our results showed that displacement up to 117.4 km and captivity up to 514 days did not disrupt homing ability nor diminish fidelity to the home area. However, for homing turtles we infer energetic costs and heightened risk in unfamiliar coastal waters. Confirmed homing suggests that moving individuals away from danger might offer short-term benefit (e.g. rescue from an oil spill), but moving turtles to a new foraging area is unlikely to succeed as a long-term conservation strategy. Priority must rather be placed on protecting their original habitat.},

Increasing the number of source satellites required for a valid fix is a simple filter method but it comes at the cost of great data loss. Using data sets acquired from loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta, we explored an alternative filtering approach, based on speed between successive locations, angles created by 3 consecutive locations, manufacturer’s quality index, and number of satellites used for location calculation. The performance of the proposed filter method was evaluated by conducting terrestrial, mobile tests. When our filter method was used, the linear error (mean ± {SD}) of Fastloc {GPS} data decreased from 2645.5 ± 29458.2 m (n = 1328) to 47.1 ± 61.0 m (n = 1246), while retaining more than 94\% of data.

Here we recommend using the Laplace approximation combined with automatic differentiation (as implemented in the novel R package Template Model Builder; {TMB}) for the fast fitting of continuous?time multivariate non?Gaussian {SSMs}. Through Argos satellite tracking data, we demonstrate that the use of continuous?time t?distributed measurement errors for error?prone data is more robust to outliers and improves the location estimation compared to using discretized?time t?distributed errors (implemented with a Gibbs sampler) or using continuous?time Gaussian errors (as with the Kalman filter). Using {TMB}, we are able to estimate additional parameters compared to previous methods, all without requiring a substantial increase in computational time. The model implementation is made available through the R package {argosTrack}.},

It relies on a particular caribou behavior, i.e., in the summer, caribou aggregate in large, compact groups that afford protection against blood-sucking insects. During this aggregation period, biologists in aircraft search the caribou summer range trying to detect signals emitted by radio-collared animals and to locate the groups. Unfortunately, some radio-collared animals and their associated groups are missed. The groups that are found are photographed and enumerated, but the total number of photographed caribou underestimates the herd population since groups having no collared animals and some groups with collared animals are missed. This paper proposes a stochastic model to correct the abundance estimator for group undercoverage. An estimator for the size of the population is proposed with an associated variance estimate. The analysis of the July 1993 postcalving photographic inventory of the Riviere George herd is presented as an illustration.},

Most of the 19 experimental feeding events that occurred during the 51 dives recorded resulted in specific acceleration patterns that were clearly distinguishable from swimming accelerations. The differential acceleration between the head-mounted and jaw-mounted accelerometers detected 84\% of prey captures on the vertical axis and 89\% on the horizontal axis. However, the jaw-mounted accelerometer alone proved to be equally effective at detecting prey capture attempts. Acceleration along the horizontal (surge)-axis appeared to be particularly efficient in detecting prey captures, and suggests that a single accelerometer placed under the jaw of a pinniped is a promising and easily implemented means of recording prey capture attempts.},

	abstract = {Understanding the diving behaviour of diving predators in relation to concomitant prey distribution could have major practical applications in conservation biology by allowing the assessment of how changes in fine scale prey distribution impact foraging efficiency and ultimately population dynamics. The southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina, hereafter {SES}), the largest phocid, is a major predator of the southern ocean feeding on myctophids and cephalopods. Because of its large size it can carry bio-loggers with minimal disturbance. Moreover, it has great diving abilities and a wide foraging habitat. Thus, the {SES} is a well suited model species to study predator diving behaviour and the distribution of ecologically important prey species in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we examined how {SESs} adjust their diving behaviour and horizontal movements in response to fine scale prey encounter densities using high resolution accelerometers, magnetometers, pressure sensors and {GPS} loggers. When high prey encounter rates were encountered, animals responded by (1) diving and returning to the surface with steeper angles, reducing the duration of transit dive phases (thus improving dive efficiency), and (2) exhibiting more horizontally and vertically sinuous bottom phases. In these cases, the distance travelled horizontally at the surface was reduced. This behaviour is likely to counteract horizontal displacement from water currents, as they try to remain within favourable prey patches. The prey encounter rate at the bottom of dives decreased with increasing diving depth, suggesting a combined effect of decreased accessibility and prey density with increasing depth. Prey encounter rate also decreased when the bottom phases of dives were spread across larger vertical extents of the water column. This result suggests that the vertical aggregation of prey can regulate prey density, and as a consequence impact the foraging success of {SESs}. To our knowledge, this is one of only a handful of studies showing how the vertical distributions and structure of prey fields influence the prey encounter rates of a diving predator.},

	abstract = {Moving object data handling has received a fair share of attention over recent years in the spatial database community. This is understandable as positioning technology is rapidly making its way into the consumer market, not only through the already ubiquitous cell phone but soon also through small, on-board positioning devices in many means of transport and in other types of portable equipment. It is thus to be expected that all these devices will start to generate an unprecedented data stream of time-stamped positions. Sooner or later, such enormous volumes of data will lead to storage, transmission, computation, and display challenges. Hence, the need for compression techniques.Although previously some work has been done in compression for time series data, this work mainly deals with one-dimensional time series. On the other hand, they are good for short time series and in absence of noise, two characteristics not met by moving objects.We target applications in which present and past positions of objects are important, so focus on the compression of moving object trajectories. The paper applies some older techniques of line generalization, and compares their performance against algorithms that we specifically designed for compressing moving object trajectories.},

To make the {BM} approach computationally feasible for high-dimensional (big) data, we exploit the properties of the processes along with approximations to the likelihood to break the high-dimensional problem into a series of lower dimensional problems. To implement the alternative, downscaling approach, we use R-{INLA} to connect the two sources of observations via a linear mixed effect model. We compare the predictions of the two approaches by cross-validation as well as simulations. Our results show that both approaches yield similar results—both provide accurate, high resolution estimates of the at-sea locations of the northern fur seals, as well as Bayesian credible intervals to characterize the uncertainty about the estimated movement paths.},

Food-chain length is predicted to be shorter in ecosystems subjected to greater disturbance because longer chains are theoretically less resilient to perturbation. Moreover, food-chain length is expected to be longer in larger ecosystems because increasing ecosystem size increases species richness and stabilizes predator–prey interactions, or increases total resource availability. Here we test the roles of disturbance and ecosystem size in determining the food-chain length of terrestrial food webs on Bahamian islands. We found that disturbance affected the identity of top predators, but did not change food-chain length because alternative top predators occupied similar trophic positions. On the other hand, a 106- fold increase in ecosystem size elevated food-chain length by one trophic level. We suggest that the effect of disturbance on food-chain length is weak when alternate top predators are trophic omnivores and have similar trophic positions. This and previous work in lakes suggest that ecosystem size may be a strong determinant of food-chain length in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The growing capacity to process and store animal tracks has spurred the development of new methods to segment animal trajectories into elementary units of movement. Key challenges for movement trajectory segmentation are to (i) minimize the need of supervision, (ii) reduce computational costs, (iii) minimize the need of prior assumptions (e.g. simple parametrizations), and (iv) capture biologically meaningful semantics, useful across a broad range of species. We introduce the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering ({EMbC}), a general purpose, unsupervised approach to multivariate data clustering. The {EMbC} is a variant of the Expectation-Maximization Clustering ({EMC}), a clustering algorithm based on the maximum likelihood estimation of a Gaussian mixture model. This is an iterative algorithm with a closed form step solution and hence a reasonable computational cost. The method looks for a good compromise between statistical soundness and ease and generality of use (by minimizing prior assumptions and favouring the semantic interpretation of the final clustering). Here we focus on the suitability of the {EMbC} algorithm for behavioural annotation of movement data. We show and discuss the {EMbC} outputs in both simulated trajectories and empirical movement trajectories including different species and different tracking methodologies. We use synthetic trajectories to assess the performance of {EMbC} compared to classic {EMC} and Hidden Markov Models. Empirical trajectories allow us to explore the robustness of the {EMbC} to data loss and data inaccuracies, and assess the relationship between {EMbC} output and expert label assignments. Additionally, we suggest a smoothing procedure to account for temporal correlations among labels, and a proper visualization of the output for movement trajectories. Our algorithm is available as an R-package with a set of complementary functions to ease the analysis.},

Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis ({BCPA}), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The {BCPA} is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a {GPS} movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the {ARGOS} tracking system.

	abstract = {Many animals undertake movements that are longer scaled and more directed than their typical home ranging behaviour. These movements include seasonal migrations (e.g. between breeding and feeding grounds), natal dispersal, nomadic range shifts and responses to local environmental disruptions. While various heuristic tools exist for identifying range shifts and migrations, none explicitly model the movement of the animals within a statistical framework that facilitates quantitative comparisons. We present the mechanistic range shift analysis ({MRSA}), a method to estimate a suite of range shift parameters: times of initiation, duration of transitions, centroids and areas of respective ranges. The method can take the autocorrelation and irregular sampling that is characteristic of much movement data into account. The mechanistic parameters suggest an intuitive measure, the range shift index, for the extent of a range shift. The likelihood based estimation further allows for statistical tests of several relevant hypotheses, including a range shift test, a stopover test and a site fidelity test. The analysis tools are provided in an R package (marcher). We applied the {MRSA} to a population of {GPS} tracked roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Italian Alps between 2005 and 2008. With respect to seasonal migration, this population is extremely variable and difficult to classify. Using the {MRSA}, we were able to quantify the behaviours across the population and among individuals across years, identifying extents, durations and locations of seasonal range shifts, including cases that would have been ambiguous to detect using existing tools. The strongest patterns were differences across years: many animals simply did not perform a seasonal migration to wintering grounds during the mild winter of 2006–2007, even though some of these same animals did move extensively in other, harsher winters. For seasonal migrants, however, site fidelity across years was extremely high, even after skipping an entire seasonal migration. These results suggest that for roe deer behavioural plasticity and tactical responses to immediate environmental cues are reflected in the decision of whether rather than where to migrate. The {MRSA} also revealed a trade-off between the probability of migrating and the size of a home range.},

	abstract = {To be useful, definitions of animal movement behavior (e.g. migration) should be quantitatively rigorous, flexible enough to accommodate variation in species biology (e.g. latitudinal vs elevational movement) and sufficiently general to allow comparison among different species. Recent studies have applied a model-driven approach to classifying and quantifying animal movement from global positioning system ({GPS}) location data. We improve upon these methods by 1) revising model structure to provide a simple biologically-defensible basis to reduce misclassification; 2) introducing a data-efficient tool that can be used to quantify and circumvent model sensitivity to starting location; and 3) illustrating how existing models can be adapted to describe short-distance migration, using elevational migration as an example. These improve- ments are included in ‘{migrateR}', an open source R package that expands and automates model-driven classification and quantification of animal movement behavior. We demonstrate the software and these improved methods using {GPS}-collar location data from a long-distance migrant, elk Cervus elaphus, and a short-distance elevational migrant, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis sierrae. We provide in-text example code and a supplementary script illustrating how default options can be revised to meet several common challenges in fitting movement models.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in animal tracking technology have permitted the collection of detailed data on the movement paths of individuals from many species. However, analysis methods for these data have not developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration), exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area?restricted (e.g., foraging), and other types of movement. Using this ?toolbox? of nested model components, multistate movement models may be custom?built for a wide variety of species and applications. As a unified state?space modeling framework, it allows the simultaneous investigation of numerous hypotheses about animal movement from imperfectly observed data, including time allocations to different movement behavior states, transitions between states, the use of memory or navigation, and strengths of attraction (or repulsion) to specific locations. The inclusion of covariate information permits further investigation of specific hypotheses related to factors driving different types of movement behavior. Using reversible?jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to facilitate Bayesian model selection and multi?model inference, we apply the proposed methodology to real data by adapting it to the natural history of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) in the North Sea. Although previous grey seal studies tended to focus on correlated movements, we found overwhelming evidence that bias toward haul?out or foraging locations better explained seal movement than did simple or correlated random walks. Posterior model probabilities also provided evidence that seals transition among directed, area?restricted, and exploratory movements associated with haul?out, foraging, and other behaviors. With this intuitive framework for modeling and interpreting animal movement, we believe that the development and application of custom?made movement models will become more accessible to ecologists and non?statisticians.},

	abstract = {When data streams are observed without error and at regular time intervals, discrete-time hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) have become immensely popular for the analysis of animal location and auxiliary biotelemetry data. However, measurement error and temporally irregular data are often pervasive in telemetry studies, particularly in marine systems. While relatively small amounts of missing data that are missing-completely-at-random are not typically problematic in {HMMs}, temporal irregularity can result in few (if any) observations aligning with the regular time steps required by {HMMs}. Fitting {HMMs} that explicitly account for uncertainty attributable to location measurement error, temporally irregular observations, or other forms of missing data typically requires computationally demanding techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}). Using simulation and a real-world bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) example, I investigate a practical alternative to incorporating measurement error and temporally irregular observations into {HMMs} based on multiple imputation of the position process drawn from a single-state continuous-time movement model. This two-stage approach is relatively simple, performed with existing software using efficient maximum likelihood methods, and completely parallelizable. I generally found the approach to perform well across a broad range of simulated measurement error and irregular sampling rates, with latent states and locations reliably recovered in nearly all simulated scenarios. However, high measurement error coupled with low sampling rates often induced bias in both the estimated probability distributions of data streams derived from the imputed position process and the estimated effects of spatial covariates on state transition probabilities. Results from the two-stage analysis of the bearded seal data were similar to a more computationally intensive single-stage {MCMC} analysis, but the two-stage analysis required much less computation time and no custom model-fitting algorithms. I thus found the two-stage multiple-imputation approach to be promising in terms of its ease of implementation, computation time, and performance. Code for implementing the approach using the R package “{momentuHMM}” is provided.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.},

	abstract = {Background Although habitat use reflects a dynamic process, most studies assess habitat use statically as if an animal's successively recorded locations reflected a point rather than a movement process. By relying on the activity time between successive locations instead of the local density of individual locations, movement-based methods can substantially improve the biological relevance of utilization distribution ({UD}) estimates (i.e. the relative frequencies with which an animal uses the various areas of its home range, {HR}). One such method rests on Brownian bridges ({BBs}). Its theoretical foundation (purely and constantly diffusive movements) is paradoxically inconsistent with both {HR} settlement and habitat selection. An alternative involves movement-based kernel density estimation ({MKDE}) through location interpolation, which may be applied to various movement behaviours but lacks a sound theoretical basis. Methodology/Principal Findings I introduce the concept of a biased random (advective-diffusive) bridge ({BRB}) and show that the {MKDE} method is a practical means to estimate {UDs} based on simplified (isotropically diffusive) {BRBs}. The equation governing {BRBs} is constrained by the maximum delay between successive relocations warranting constant within-bridge advection (allowed to vary between bridges) but remains otherwise similar to the {BB} equation. Despite its theoretical inconsistencies, the {BB} method can therefore be applied to animals that regularly reorientate within their {HRs} and adapt their movements to the habitats crossed, provided that they were relocated with a high enough frequency. Conclusions/Significance Biased random walks can approximate various movement types at short times from a given relocation. Their simplified form constitutes an effective trade-off between too simple, unrealistic movement models, such as Brownian motion, and more sophisticated and realistic ones, such as biased correlated random walks ({BCRWs}), which are too complex to yield functional bridges. Relying on simplified {BRBs} proves to be the most reliable and easily usable way to estimate {UDs} from serially correlated relocations and raw activity information.},

Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the {BBMM} by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current {BBMM} as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for {GPS} tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5.

Movement behaviors such as long-distance searching and fine-scale foraging, however, are often intermixed but operate on vastly different spatial and temporal scales. An approach that integrates the full sweep of movement behaviors across scales is currently lacking.

Applying our {LSP}-based analytical protocol to tracking data from three species revealed that an ungulate exhibited periodicity in its movement speed but not in its locations, that a central place-foraging seabird tracked moon phase, and that the movements of a range-resident canid included a daily patrolling component that was initially masked by the stochasticity of the movements.

In this paper, we start from the observation that existing two-table ordination techniques and related measures of niche breadth inevitably weight a sample in proportion to its abundance. We introduce a new multivariate method, which gives a more even weight to all sampling units, including those which are species poor or individual poor. We use this new method of analysis which we call {OMI} (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or species marginality, measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the niche hyperspace), and {OMI} analysis places species along habitat conditions using a maximization of their mean {OMI}. Therefore, the position of the species depends on their niche deviation from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat conditions). We demonstrate that {OMI} analysis is well suited for the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or strong driving forces (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient). Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological factors are most important for community structure and organization and provides a separation of species based on their niche characteristics.},

There are several aspects of {SSFs} where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research.

Past efforts to model behavioral changes over time used Bayesian statistical models with variable parameter space, such as reversible- jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, which are computationally demanding and inaccessible to many practitioners.We present a continuous- time discrete-space ({CTDS}) model of animal movement that can be fit using standard generalized linear modeling ({GLM}) methods. This {CTDS} approach allows for the joint modeling of location-based as well as directional drivers of movement. Changing behavior over time is modeled using a varying- coefficient framework which maintains the computational simplicity of a {GLM} approach, and variable selection is accomplished using a group lasso penalty.We apply our approach to a study of two mountain lions (Puma con- color) in Colorado, {USA}.},

	abstract = {Optical remote sensing is an important tool in the study of animal behavior providing ecologists with the means to understand species–environment interactions in combination with animal movement data. However, differences in spatial and temporal resolution between movement and remote sensing data limit their direct assimilation. In this context, we built a data-driven framework to map resource suitability that addresses these differences as well as the limitations of satellite imagery. It combines seasonal composites of multiyear surface reflectances and optimized presence and absence samples acquired with animal movement data within a cross-validation modeling scheme. Moreover, it responds to dynamic, site-specific environmental conditions making it applicable to contrasting landscapes. We tested this framework using five populations of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) to model resource suitability related to foraging achieving accuracies from 0.40 to 0.94 for presences and 0.66 to 0.93 for absences. These results were influenced by the temporal composition of the seasonal reflectances indicated by the lower accuracies associated with higher day differences in relation to the target dates. Additionally, population differences in resource selection influenced our results marked by the negative relationship between the model accuracies and the variability of the surface reflectances associated with the presence samples. Our modeling approach spatially splits presences between training and validation. As a result, when these represent different and unique resources, we face a negative bias during validation. Despite these inaccuracies, our framework offers an important basis to analyze species–environment interactions. As it standardizes site-dependent behavioral and environmental characteristics, it can be used in the comparison of intra- and interspecies environmental requirements and improves the analysis of resource selection along migratory paths. Moreover, due to its sensitivity to differences in resource selection, our approach can contribute toward a better understanding of species requirements.},

This has led to a huge demand for statistical tools that allow ecologists to draw meaningful inference from large tracking data sets. The class of hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) matches the intuitive understanding that animal movement is driven by underlying behavioural modes and has proven to be very useful for analysing movement data. For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package {moveHMM} allows ecologists to process {GPS} tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an {HMM} to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of {moveHMM} using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus. Our findings illustrate the role our software, and movement modelling in general, can play in conservation and management by illuminating environmental constraints.},

The recent Brownian bridge movement model ({BBMM}), which incorporates measurement errors, has been quickly adopted by ecologists because of its simplicity and tractability. We discuss some nontrivial properties of the discrete?time stochastic process that results from observing a Brownian motion with added normal noise at discrete times. In particular, we demonstrate that the observed sequence of random variables is not Markov. Consequently the expected occupation time between two successively observed locations does not depend on just those two observations; the whole path must be taken into account. Nonetheless, the exact likelihood function of the observed time series remains tractable; it requires only sparse matrix computations. The likelihood?based estimation procedure is described in detail and compared to the {BBMM} estimation.},

The Global Positioning System provides relatively continuous animal tracking over time and long distances. Nevertheless, the continuous trajectory of an animal’s movement is usually only observed at discrete time points. Brownian bridge models have been used to model movement of an animal between two observed locations within a reasonably short time interval. Assuming that animals are in perpetual motion, these models ignore inactivity such as resting or sleeping. Using the latest developments in applied probability, we propose a moving–resting process model where an animal is assumed to alternate between a moving state, during which it moves in a Brownian motion, and a resting state, during which it does not move. Theoretical properties of the process are studied as a first step towards more realistic models for animal movements. Analytic expressions are derived for the distribution of one increment and two consecutive increments, and are validated with simulations. The induced bridge model conditioning on the starting and end points is used to compute an animal’s probability of occurrence in an observation area during the time of observation, which has wide applications in wildlife behavior research.},

	abstract = {Wildlife scientists continue to be interested in studying ways to quantify how the movements of animals are inter-dependent - dynamic interaction. While a number of applied studies of dynamic interaction exist, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and applicability of available methods used for quantifying interactions among animals. We highlight the formulation, implementation, and interpretation of a suite of eight currently available indices of dynamic interaction. Point- and path-based approaches are contrasted to demonstrate differences between methods and underlying assumptions on telemetry data. Correlated and biased-correlated random walks were simulated at a range of sampling resolutions to generate scenarios with dynamic interaction present and absent. We evaluate the effectiveness of each index at identifying differing types of interactive behaviour at each sampling resolution. Each index is then applied to an empirical telemetry dataset of three white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) dyads. Results from the simulated data show that three indices of dynamic interaction reliant on statistical testing procedures are susceptible to Type I error, which increases at fine sampling resolutions. In the white-tailed deer examples, a recently developed index for quantifying local-level cohesive movement behaviour (the di index) provides revealing information on the presence of infrequent and varying interactions in space and time. Point-based approaches implemented with finely sampled telemetry data over-estimate the presence of interactions (Type I errors). Indices producing only a single global statistic (7 of the 8 indices) are unable to quantify infrequent and varying interactions through time. The quantification of infrequent and variable interactive behaviour has important implications for the spread of disease, and the prevalence of social behaviour in wildlife. Guidelines are presented to inform researchers wishing to study dynamic interaction patterns in their own telemetry datasets. Finally, we make openly available our code, in the statistical software R, for computing each index of dynamic interaction presented herein. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Abstract The flight performance of birds is strongly affected by the dynamic state of the atmosphere at the birds' locations. Studies of flight and its impact on the movement ecology of birds must consider the wind to help us understand aerodynamics and bird flight strategies. Here, we introduce a systematic approach to evaluate wind speed and direction from the high?frequency {GPS} recordings from bird?borne tags during thermalling flight. Our method assumes that a fixed horizontal mean wind speed during a short (18seconds, 19 {GPS} fixes) flight segment with a constant turn angle along a closed loop, characteristic of thermalling flight, will generate a fixed drift for each consequent location. We use a maximum?likelihood approach to estimate that drift and to determine the wind and airspeeds at the birds' flight locations. We also provide error estimates for these {GPS}?derived wind speed estimates. We validate our approach by comparing its wind estimates with the mid?resolution weather reanalysis data from {ECMWF}, and by examining independent wind estimates from pairs of birds in a large dataset of {GPS}?tagged migrating storks that were flying in close proximity. Our approach provides accurate and unbiased observations of wind speed and additional detailed information on vertical winds and uplift structure. These precise measurements are otherwise rare and hard to obtain and will broaden our understanding of atmospheric conditions, flight aerodynamics, and bird flight strategies. With an increasing number of {GPS}?tracked animals, we may soon be able to use birds to inform us about the atmosphere they are flying through and thus improve future ecological and environmental studies.},

	abstract = {Background {ARGOS} satellite telemetry is one of the most widely used methods to track the movements of free-ranging marine and terrestrial animals and is fundamental to studies of foraging ecology, migratory behavior and habitat-use. {ARGOS} location estimates do not include complete error estimations, and for many marine organisms, the most commonly acquired locations (Location Class 0, A, B, or Z) are provided with no declared error estimate. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the accuracy of {ARGOS} locations to those obtained using Fastloc {GPS} from the same electronic tags on five species of pinnipeds: 9 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 4 Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), 6 Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), 3 Australian fur seals (A. p. doriferus) and 5 northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). These species encompass a range of marine habitats (highly pelagic vs coastal), diving behaviors (mean dive durations 2–21 min) and range of latitudes (equator to temperate). A total of 7,318 {ARGOS} positions and 27,046 {GPS} positions were collected. Of these, 1,105 {ARGOS} positions were obtained within five minutes of a {GPS} position and were used for comparison. The 68th percentile {ARGOS} location errors as measured in this study were {LC}-3 0.49 km, {LC}-2 1.01 km, {LC}-1 1.20 km, {LC}-0 4.18 km, {LC}-A 6.19 km, {LC}-B 10.28 km. Conclusions/Significance The {ARGOS} errors measured here are greater than those provided by {ARGOS}, but within the range of other studies. The error was non-normally distributed with each {LC} highly right-skewed. Locations of species that make short duration dives and spend extended periods on the surface (sea lions and fur seals) had less error than species like elephant seals that spend more time underwater and have shorter surface intervals. Supplemental data (S1) are provided allowing the creation of density distributions that can be used in a variety of filtering algorithms to improve the quality of {ARGOS} tracking data.},
